This is a very simple example applications that show-cases how to run
and debug an application directly from an IDE. The application uses
the existing Databricks sample datasets.

2. To run, make sure to set the environment variables for `DATABRICKS_HOST`,
   `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`, `DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_ID`. Alternatively, please see
   [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-connect-ref.html#set-up-the-client)
